--  * I don't use any explicit buffering. In my experiments it speeds up the
--    program by less than 10%, while considerably increasing the complexity.
--  * The LuaJIT version needs to be separate, due to the lack of bitwise ops.
--  * The output is in the Netpbm file format. Use an image viewer to view the picture.

local mandelbrot = require(arg[1])
local N   = tonumber(arg[2]) or 100
--local REP = tonumber(arg[3]) or 1

io.write(string.format("P4\n%d %d\n", N, N))
mandelbrot.mandelbrot(N)
